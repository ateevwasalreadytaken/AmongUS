# AmongUS

You are playing the popular multiplayer murder mystery game ​Among Us , in which there are one or more 1
impostors among a group of crewmates on a spaceship. The impostors’ goal is to sabotage the spaceship by 
killing all their crewmates before the crew finishes their tasks; the crewmates win by either completing their 
tasks or ejecting the impostors out of the spaceship before they can kill everyone. Impostors have access to an 
underground vent network that allows them to quickly move across the spaceship without detection. If a 
crewmate dies, they become a “ghost”; ghosts can still complete their tasks, and they can travel without 
restriction throughout the map. In this project, you will be playing the roles of both an Impostor (Part A) and a 
ghost Crewmate (Parts B and C) to identify efficient routes through the spaceship that will help you win the 
game.
